JPG to WebP Converter

This Python script converts all JPG files in a specified directory to WebP format, with a quality level of 60 and lossy compression. The output files are saved in a separate directory with the same file name and a .webp extension.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Installation

    Install Python 3.x on your system.
    Install PIL by running pip install pillow in your command prompt or terminal.
    Download or clone this repository to your computer.

Notes

    The output directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.
    The script only converts files with a .jpg extension. If you want to convert other file types, you'll need to modify the script.
    The quality level and compression type can be changed by modifying the convert_jpg_to_webp function in the script.
    This script has been tested on Windows 11
